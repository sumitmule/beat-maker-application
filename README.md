# Beat Maker :control_knobs:
It is a basic *'Beat Maker'* application built using the **` Pygame `** library for Python.  
<br>

Application programming is a great way to learn coding as one gets visual feedback whenever they implement something in the source code. In addition to this, one gets to make something thatâ€™s useful to the user.

Beat Maker is a classic drum machine and can be used for basic music composition. It is simple to implement and fun to play :pager:.  
<br>

### Features of the application : 

The app allows user to highlight cells (:green_square:) corresponding to different instruments in the drum set and the program mixes them together to make a sound :notes:. These different beats are played one after another to make a complete looping beat.

> This program is inspired by the Bosca Ceoil program which is used in making music for many different applications and games.

It also has the functionality to change the speed of the beats played :fast_forward: and the number of beats in a loop.

### Tech/Framework used :

1. Language : Python
2. Code Editor : VS Code 
3. Library : [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)  

> Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It already contains many predefined modules so you can focus more on the logical part of the game rather than the GUI part.

### Instructions :

In order to make changes to the code or to run the application you will need to install `Pygame` library on your machine.  
>pip install pygame  

In order to run the .exe application file, you will need the to download the following things and make sure they are in the same directory :file_folder:.
1. final.exe file
2. Sounds folder
3. logo.png file
4. Roboto-Bold.ttf font file
<br>

### Things implemented in this project :

- Creating a window using pygame and set up a basic game loop.
- Drawing shapes using screen coordinates.
- Handling user input to play desired sound beats and controlling other functionality like play/pause, adding beats etc.<br>
<br>

> The user experience can be improved by adding other instruments, adding a save/load and sharing features.
