# Beat Maker  
It is a basic *'Beat Maker'* application built using the **` Pygame `** library for Python.  
<br>

Application programming is a great way to learn coding as one gets visual feedback whenever they implement something in the source code. In addition to this, one gets to make something thatâ€™s useful to the user.

Beat Maker is a classic drum machine and can be used for basic music composition. It is simple to implement and fun to play.  
<br>

### Features of the application : 

In the application, the user is able to highlight cells corresponding to different instruments in the drum set and the program mixes them together to make a sound. These different beats are played one after another to make a complete looping beat.

> This program is inspired by the Bosca Ceoil program which is used in making music for many different applications and games.

It also has the functionality to change the speed of the beats played and the number of beats in a loop.

### Tech/Framework used :

1. Language : Python
2. Code Editor : VS Code 
3. Library : [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)  

> Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It already contains many predefined modules so you can focus more on the logical part of the game rather than the GUI part.

### Instructions :

In order to make changes to the code or to play the game you will need to install and setup raylib on your machine.  
You can refer to this link : [Raylib setup](https://youtu.be/a2IUxJFr8sg)

You can directly download the .exe file and play the game (make sure you setup raylib first).  

>Instructions about how to play the game :
- Use W,S keys to control the player paddel (and arrow keays for 2 player mode).
- Use the spacebar to go to the next level.
- If you lose, the game restarts from level 1.
- The difficulty increases as you move to the higher levels.  
<br>

### Things implemented in this project :

1. Creating a window (with flags) and set up a basic game loop.
2. Drawing shapes using screen coordinates.
3. Controling the PC gameplay depending on how the player plays the game.<br>
<br>

> The user experience can be improved by adding GUI, Welcome Screen, Scoreboard etc.
